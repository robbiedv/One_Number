### Data that needs ranked and scored individually ###

#1 year stats, 0 - 100

#trends, 0 - 100

#prediction (takes into account trades etc. use NHL) 0 - 100

#draftability (based on mock drafts) 0 - 100


### Compile all data and give overall score ###

#create a scoring system,
# 0 = worst
# 100 = best

### Create drafting strategy ###

#few good players at position

#roster slots
#C = 4
#LW = 4
#RW = 4
#D = 6
#G = 2

### Generate draft ranked draft list ###

### Export into easy to read doc ###
