# One Number
An app that helps draft a winning Fantasy Hockey Team

### How It Works

##### Web Scraping
Using the Python Library [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) the app scrapes the web for specific stats on each Hockey player

##### Crunching the Numbers
Taking multiple factors into account, the app ranks players based on their value in Fantasy Hockey, removing the need for lots of spreadsheets with hand typed data on Draft Day 

### Future Features
- Draft Strategy
- Starting Linup Strategy
- Free Agent Rankings
